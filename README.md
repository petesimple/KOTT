👑 King of the Table (KOTT)

King of the Table is a web-based rotating scoreboard system built for fast-paced multi-player air hockey chaos.
Two players battle, one player waits on deck, and everyone else chills in the queue.
Survive long enough and you’re King… until a Blue Shell ruins your life.

⸻

🎮 How It Works
	•	Enter 3 to 20 players
	•	The first three are assigned:
	•	🔴 Left Player (Active)
	•	🔵 Right Player (Active)
	•	🟡 On Deck Player
	•	All others go into the rotation queue

Every point changes the battlefield.

🏒 Scoring Logic

When a goal is scored:
	•	✅ The scorer stays
	•	🔄 The loser rotates out
	•	⬆️ The On Deck player rotates in
	•	⬇️ The loser goes to the end of the queue

Tap a player’s score circle to award a goal.

🐢 The Blue Shell Rule

If a player gets scored on while they have exactly 6 points:

💥 BLUE SHELL
	•	Their score resets to 0
	•	They receive a Blue Shell token
	•	A small blue shell icon appears next to their name

Blue Shells are permanent trophies of shame.
