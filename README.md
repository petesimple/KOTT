👑 King of the Table (KOTT)

King of the Table is a web based rotating scoreboard built for fast paced multiplayer air hockey chaos.
Two players battle. One waits on deck. Everyone else lives in the queue.
Survive long enough and you are King… until a Blue Shell ruins your life.

⸻

🎮 How It Works

Enter 3 to 20 players.

The first three are assigned automatically
🔴 Left Player (active)
🟡 Right Player (active)
🟢 Waiting player (on deck)

All remaining players go into the rotation queue.

Every goal reshuffles the kingdom.

⸻

🏒 Scoring and Rotation

When a goal is scored
• The scorer stays on the table
• The loser rotates out
• The waiting player rotates in
• The loser goes to the back of the queue

To score, tap the puck of the player who made the goal.

🐢 The Blue Shell Rule

If a player gets scored on while sitting at exactly 6 points…

💥 BLUE SHELL
• Their score resets to 0
• The scorer gains one Blue Shell
• A shell icon appears next to the scorer’s name

Blue Shells are permanent trophies of shame and pride.

🏆 Win Conditions

A player becomes King of the Table by
• Reaching 7 points
OR
• Collecting 3 Blue Shells

When someone wins
• The game stops
• Graffiti style victory effects fire
• Blue Shell explosions erupt

🌶️ Restart Behavior (v1.5)

Restart Game now asks a very important question.

Do you want
• The same player order for fairness and peace
• Or a fully randomized order for chaos and destiny

Either way
• Scores reset
• Blue shells clear
• Timer restarts
• Logs and undo history reset
• Swap Sides is re enabled until the first goal

Same players. Fresh vibes.
